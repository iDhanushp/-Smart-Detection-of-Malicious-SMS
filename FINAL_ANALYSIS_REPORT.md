   - Create verified sender database
   - Boost confidence for known legitimate senders (banks, telecom, etc.)
   - Reduce false positives on service messages

2. **Confidence Thresholds**
   - Consider messages below 0.5 confidence as "uncertain"
   - Implement user feedback mechanism for borderline cases
   - Allow user customization of sensitivity levels

3. **Educational Content Handling**
   - Improve detection of legitimate educational institutions
   - Better classification of course/training advertisements
   - Consider user context (student vs. general user)

#### üöÄ Advanced Features

1. **Sender Reputation**
   - Implement sender trust scoring
   - Learn from user interactions (mark as spam/not spam)
   - Maintain local reputation database

2. **User Customization**
   - Allow users to adjust spam sensitivity
   - Whitelist trusted contacts/services
   - Learn from user behavior patterns

3. **Regional Optimization**
   - Improve local language detection
   - Add region-specific fraud patterns
   - Better handling of local service codes
