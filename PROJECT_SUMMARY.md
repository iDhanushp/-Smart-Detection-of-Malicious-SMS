## Sender Validation Logic

### Trusted Sender Patterns
- **Alphanumeric IDs**: Bank/app sender IDs (e.g., HDFCBK, VM-AIRTEL, BX-ICICIB)
- **Short Codes**: 4-6 digit numeric codes (likely trusted services)
- **Pattern Recognition**: Regex-based validation for sender patterns

### Suspicious Sender Patterns
- **Phone Numbers**: Messages from unknown numbers with country codes
- **Unknown Patterns**: Senders that don't match trusted patterns
- **Risk Assessment**: Automatic flagging of suspicious senders

### Detection Workflow
1. **Sender Analysis**: Check sender pattern first
2. **Trust Assessment**: Determine if sender is trusted
3. **ML Processing**: Apply AI model only to suspicious senders
4. **Result Classification**: Provide detailed reasoning for decisions

## Enhanced Detection Dashboard

### Modern UI Components
- **Status Card**: Dynamic gradient card showing protection status
- **Statistics Grid**: 4-metric dashboard with color-coded cards
- **Control Panel**: Professional settings interface with enhanced switches
- **Activity Feed**: Recent detection history with detailed information
- **Scan Button**: Beautiful gradient button for manual scanning

### Interactive Features
